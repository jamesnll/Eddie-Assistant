# Eddie-Book-Assistant
Eddie is a virtual assistant designed to provide a seamless, book-focused question-answering experience. Inspired by Alexa, Eddie integrates an ESP32 embedded system for real-time voice interaction and a fine-tuned GPT-2 model hosted on a Flask web server. The fine-tuned GPT-2 model, written in Python and deployed on a separate machine, processes book-related queries with enhanced accuracy. The ESP32 acts as a client system, written in C++, which captures user input, sends queries to the Flask server, and receives responses to provide spoken output.
## Features
* Fine-Tuned GPT-2 Model: Curated dataset enhances accuracy and relevance for book-focused queries.  
* Flask Web Server: Manages incoming requests from the ESP32 client, facilitating the processing of user questions and returning responses efficiently.
