# Eddie-Assistant
Eddie is a **semantic TV show recommender system** designed to deliver personalized show suggestions based on user preferences. Using **vector search** and **OpenAI embeddings**, Eddie leverages semantic understanding to provide more accurate and contextually relevant recommendations. The Python portion of the project is hosted on a local Flask server, which handles query processing, interacts with OpenAI embeddings for semantic search, and returns recommendations. The system is interfaced with an **ESP32 client**, where **FreeRTOS** tasks allow the user can speak into a microphone, query the server for recommendations, and receive spoken responses through **TTS** and a speaker.
## Features
- **Kaggle Datasets:** Uses a curated set of TV show-related datasets from Kaggle to improve recommendation accuracy and diversity.
- **Vector Search with OpenAI Embeddings:** Utilizes semantic understanding to search and recommend TV shows based on user queries.
- **Flask Web Server:** Hosts the recommendation engine, processes incoming queries from the ESP32 client, and returns show recommendations.
- **ESP32 Client Integration with FreeRTOS:** Captures user input via a microphone in C, sends queries to the Flask server, handles tasks such as voice input, server queries, TTS output, and Wi-Fi connectivity using FreeRTOS.
- **Real-Time Voice Interaction:** Enables users to interact with the system through speech, creating a hands-free, conversational experience.
