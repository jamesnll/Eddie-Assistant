# Eddie-Book-Assistant
Eddie is a virtual assistant designed to provide a seamless question-answering experience focused on books. With a setup inspired by Alexa, Eddie combines an ESP32 embedded system for real-time voice interaction and a fine-tuned GPT-2 model curated specifically for book-related questions. Written in Python and powered by the ESP32, Eddie takes voice input from users, queries the model, and responds with spoken output.
## Features
* Fine-Tuned GPT-2 Model: Curated dataset enhances accuracy and relevance for book-focused queries.
