# GPT-2 Fine-Tuned Model for Question Answering (Archived)

## Overview

This folder contains a Python-based implementation of a fine-tuned GPT-2 model originally developed to perform question-answering tasks on a dataset related to books. The project has since shifted focus to building a TV show recommender system, and as a result, this previous work has been archived for refer

## Archive Contents

The archive/ directory includes:

* Fine-Tuned Model Code: Python scripts for training and fine-tuning the GPT-2 model on a dataset of book-related questions and answers.

* Dataset: Multiple txt files containing associated question-answer pairs.

* Inference Scripts: Python scripts to load the fine-tuned model and perform question answering.

* Local Server Code: A Flask-based server that hosted the model for answering questions.

## Reason for Archival

The project's scope has evolved from book-related question answering to developing a TV show recommender system. While this previous work remains valuable, it is no longer the primary focus. The archived materials can still be referenced for:

* Fine-tuning GPT-2 on domain-specific datasets

* Implementing question-answering models

* Hosting AI models on a local server

## Future Plans

The new phase of the project will focus on:

* Developing a TV show recommender system using machine learning techniques

* Implementing a conversational interface for recommendations

* Integrating with an ESP32 for voice-based interactions
